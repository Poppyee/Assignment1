An interactive program is a program that has interaction between the user and the program. Concretely: the program asks questions and the user gives answers, after which the program processes these answers and prints the results.
For this assignment a program must be written that reads two sets of identifiers from standard input, applies four operations on these sets, and prints the results of these operations in standard output.
